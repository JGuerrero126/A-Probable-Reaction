        I am a coding student currently going through the coding bootcamp at
        UCLA Extension. I enjoy collecting manga and vinyl as well as playing
        video games. You can usually find me buried deep in some existential
        nightmare like
        <span>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Berserk_(manga)">"Berserk"</a>
        </span>
        or
        <span>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vagabond_(manga)">
            "Vagabond"
          </a>
        </span>
        or slaughtering demons by the hundreds in
        <span>
          <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Doom_Eternal">"DOOM"</a>
        </span>
        . When I'm not at my desk making all kinds of cool stuff, of course.
        I've been hard at work to get into multiple fields including Art,
        Writing, Programming and Designing. I hope to one day be a master of all
        like the great
